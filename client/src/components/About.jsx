        I’m learning data science and machine learning, and I love building
        things that are useful in the real world. I enjoy creating web apps and
        AI-based tools that help people and solve meaningful problems. I’m
        always curious, improving my skills, and experimenting with new
        technologies to build smarter and scalable solutions.
